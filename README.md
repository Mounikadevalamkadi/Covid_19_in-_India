# Covid_19_in_India

1. Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted health systems and economies worldwide. This report analyzes a COVID-19 dataset to understand the distribution of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across different states/union territories in India. The goal is to derive insights that can aid in better understanding the pandemic's effects.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights

2.1 Boxplot for Confirmed Cases by State

The boxplot displayed significant variation in confirmed cases across different states. Some states have high median confirmed cases, indicating more substantial outbreaks, while others have lower values, suggesting less impact.



2.2 Proportion of Cases (Confirmed, Cured, Deaths)

The pie chart shows the distribution of confirmed cases, cured patients, and deaths. It provides a clear visual representation of the pandemic's impact, with a notable proportion of confirmed cases resulting in recoveries.


2.3 Heatmap for State-wise Correlation of Metrics

The heatmap illustrates the correlation between confirmed cases, cured patients, and deaths across states. Strong positive correlations indicate that states with more confirmed cases also tend to have higher death and recovery rates.


2.4 Recovery Rate by State

The bar plot shows the recovery rates for the top five states with the highest confirmed cases. This metric indicates how effectively each state managed to cure its patients.

2.5 Time Series Analysis of Confirmed Cases

The time series decomposition reveals trends and seasonal patterns in confirmed cases over time. This analysis helps to understand peaks and troughs in case numbers.


2.6 Deaths vs. Confirmed Cases

The scatter plot depicts the relationship between confirmed cases and deaths. A positive correlation suggests that as confirmed cases rise, the number of deaths also tends to increase.


2.7 State-wise Recovery Rate

This bar plot highlights recovery rates across different states, helping to identify which states have performed better in terms of recovering patients from COVID-19.


2.8 Heatmap of Cases by Time of Day

The heatmap demonstrates the hourly distribution of confirmed cases. It shows patterns in case reporting, which can help understand when outbreaks may peak.


3. Conclusion

This analysis of the COVID-19 dataset reveals critical insights into how the pandemic has affected different states in India. The following conclusions can be drawn:

1.There is considerable variation in confirmed cases among states, indicating differing levels of outbreak severity.

2.Recovery rates vary, with some states managing to recover a significant proportion of confirmed cases.

3.The correlation between confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths suggests that effective healthcare responses are crucial in managing outbreaks.

4.Understanding hourly patterns of case reporting can assist in optimizing healthcare responses during peak reporting times.

The insights derived from this project can inform public health strategies and help policymakers better allocate resources in combating COVID-19.
